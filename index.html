          <h2>Early 3D Achievements</h2>       
          <p>            
            My journey into 3D graphics began in 2007 when I developed an interest in 3D modeling and character animation. 
            To learn the basics, I took a short certification course at 3DSense School of Digital Art in Singapore. 
            There, I was introduced to Autodesk Maya, a powerful tool for 3D design. 
            My first project was creating a character animation walk cycle, where I practiced the principles of animation. 
            This project helped me understand the importance of movement and timing in bringing characters to life.
          </p>
          <p>
            After that, I joined a game development project where I created 3D assets and props. 
            We used the Truevision game engine and Ogre3D for the game, and I also contributed by programming in C++. 
            Working on this project taught me how to combine creativity and technical skills to build interactive experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            A big highlight of my journey was participating in an online CGFeedback 3D challenge. 
            The task was to model and render Jack Nicholson. To my surprise and excitement, 
            I won the challenge! This experience helped me improve my skills and gave me the chance to connect with talented 
            3D artists from around the world. The feedback I received during the process was incredibly helpful and inspired me 
            to keep improving.
          </p>
          <p>
            These early experiences taught me a lot and fueled my passion for creating in the world of 3D graphics.
